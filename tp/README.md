# fps112
A fully 3D doom-style first-person shooter in tkinter for some reason.

### Required modules: 
`pyscreenshot
requests
pygame
numpy
Pillow`

### How to run:
Run the `project.py` file with python to start the game.

Run `net.py` file to start a server.

Edit configurable options in the config.json file if you wish (I recommend checking out the wireframe option!). This is also how you connect to servers.

### Shortcut commands:
There aren't any. The game isn't very long or difficult so I never made any. Sorry!
