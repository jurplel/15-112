# fps112
A fully 3D doom-style first-person shooter in tkinter for some reason.

### Required modules: 
`pyscreenshot
requests
pygame
numpy
Pillow`

You should also install the font `Ubuntu-Italic.ttf` in the res folder.

### How to run:
Run the `project.py` file with python to start the game.

Run `net.py` file to start a server.

Edit configurable options in the config.json file if you wish (I recommend checking out the wireframe option!). This is also how you connect to servers.

### Main Controls:
wasd (hold) | move

r | switch weapons

tab (hold) | run

### Shortcut commands:
There is no CLI interface. Debug controls are as follows:


h | respawn

n (hold) | noclip (singleplayer only)

m | fully heal (singleplayer only)
